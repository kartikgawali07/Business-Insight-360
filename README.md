Transforming Data into Actionable Business Intelligence

Every growing organization faces a common challenge — vast amounts of data scattered across multiple departments, but limited visibility into the bigger picture.
At AtliQ Hardware, this gap inspired the creation of Business Insights 360, an end-to-end Power BI dashboard built to unify insights and empower every stakeholder to make smarter, data-driven decisions.

The Challenge

Each department — from Finance to Marketing — relied on siloed reports and static spreadsheets. Decision-makers struggled to connect the dots between sales performance, supply chain efficiency, and financial outcomes. The lack of a centralized reporting system often led to delayed insights and missed opportunities for growth.

The Solution

To address this, I developed a comprehensive Power BI analytics solution that consolidates data from multiple sources — MySQL databases and Excel/CSV files — into a single, interactive platform.
The dashboard brings together five key business areas:

Finance View: Track P&L statements, net sales, and profitability trends.

Sales View: Evaluate customer and product performance using dynamic filters and visual comparisons.

Marketing View: Analyze product reach, regional performance, and campaign effectiveness.

Supply Chain View: Monitor forecast accuracy and optimize inventory flow through real-time metrics.

Executive View: Deliver a high-level summary with KPIs and revenue breakdowns for strategic decisions.

My Role & Approach

I handled the complete end-to-end development — from data modeling and DAX formulation to designing intuitive visuals that balance aesthetics and clarity. Using Power BI best practices and tools like DAX Studio, I optimized file performance while maintaining analytical depth. The focus was to create a user-centric design that tells a story with data — simple enough for quick insights, yet powerful enough for deep analysis.

The Impact

Business Insights 360 transformed how AtliQ Hardware interacts with its data. Stakeholders can now access reliable, real-time insights within seconds — eliminating manual reporting and enabling proactive decision-making across departments. The project not only improved visibility but also instilled a culture of analytics-driven leadership within the organization.
